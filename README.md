# Nonaworks23-twist

For the Nonaworks23 biohackathon, working on Twist problem 1: "design and develop an open-source software tool capable of analyzing an oligo pool of any size and identifying potential combinations of oligos in that pool that could be assembled using restriction, PCA, Gibson-like methods or other assembly protocol. This tool aims to enhance biosecurity by ensuring that oligo pools cannot be exploited to assemble sequences that might pose risks or otherwise be subject to regulatory control."
